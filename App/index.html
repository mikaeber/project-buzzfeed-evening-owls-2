        <h2>The Science of Deadlines:</h2>
        <p>
          Studies show that deadlines can increase productivity by up to 40%.
          When people know they have a limited time to complete a task, they
          often work more efficiently.

      <div id="box2" class="box">
        <h2>Procrastination Isn't Always Bad:</h2>
        <p>
          Some research suggests that a little procrastination can actually
          enhance creativity. When you delay starting a task, your mind
          subconsciously works on it, leading to more innovative solutions.

        <h2>Your Brain Loves Lists:</h2>

        <p>
          Task management tools and to-do lists aren't just helpful—they're
          brain candy! Crossing off tasks releases dopamine, the feel-good
          hormone, making you feel accomplished and motivated.

        <h2>Parkinson's Law:</h2>
        <p>
          Ever wonder why tasks often expand to fill the time available for
          their completion? That’s Parkinson's Law in action. If you give
          yourself too much time, you'll likely take longer than necessary to
          finish the task.

      <div id="box5" class="box">
        <h2>Color-Coding for Success:</h2>
        <p>
          Using color-coding in your task management system isn't just for
          looks—colors can improve memory and focus. Assigning specific colors
          to tasks based on urgency or type can help you prioritize and stay
          organized more effectively. Follow the
