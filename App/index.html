        <h2>The Science of Deadlines:</h2>
        <p>
          Studies show that deadlines can increase productivity by up to 40%.
          When people know they have a limited time to complete a task, they
          often work more efficiently.

        <h2>Procrastination Isn't Always Bad:</h2>
        <p>
          Some research suggests that a little procrastination can actually
          enhance creativity. When you delay starting a task, your mind
          subconsciously works on it, leading to more innovative solutions.

        <p>

        <h2>Parkinson's Law:</h2>
        <p>
          Ever wonder why tasks often expand to fill the time available for
          their completion? That’s Parkinson's Law in action. If you give
          yourself too much time, you'll likely take longer than necessary to
          finish the task.

        <h2>Color-Coding for Success:</h2>
        <p>
          Using color-coding in your task management system isn't just for
          looks—colors can improve memory and focus. Assigning specific colors
          to tasks based on urgency or type can help you prioritize and stay
          organized more effectively. Follow the
